# What is Vayu
Vayu is a command-line interface like taskwarrior meant for task management. The end goal for the tool is to have a multipurpose study tool with note storage, task management, and pomodoro study timers/music.
# Installation
Currently the best way to install vayu is by cloning the repository and running the script ./vayu which is housed in the release folder. I plan to release the fully completed application through crates.io so that
installation can occur through cargo.
